[Project 1 name](https://analousc.github.io/project-1/project%201.html) is an interactive web experience showcasing the different stages of my life.

### Description

The purpose of my project is to illustrate how finding my Nigerian roots and Nigerian spirituality helped me grow into the woman I am today. The primary page of the website will showcase me at different stages in my life, as a young girl confused about her dad’s death, as a middle schooler insecure in her blackness, as a high schooler struggling with mental illness, and finally as a college student beginning to accept herself. As the audience goes through each stage, they’ll be met with two links within a poem. One of the links moves the audience back into the past, while the other link will move the audience forward and into the future. By the end of the website, the audience will be able to see and understand the full circle journey created by the hypernarrative.
